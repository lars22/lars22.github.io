# DotCrosse using Thomsoon HTML5 template on StaceyCMS
The DotCrosse Site using the StaceyApp CMS. This will be using the same template/layout used in the DotCrosse_V2 repo.

This theme makes use of the Thomsoon template by http://thomsoon.com/. This project integrates the template into the StaceyApp (http://www.staceyapp.com/) built by kolber (http://github.com/kolber/).

I left some parts as-is (i.e. with my name hard-coded into the site) for aesthetic purposes, as this project is mainly for me to integrate the template into the theme engine. A separate repository will be made for a blank/clean-slate code for everyone's pleasure.
